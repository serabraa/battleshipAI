Hello, everyone, this is a simple README material for our program.
Program is an AI specified for the optimal game in Battleship game which is using Monte Carlo simulation to achieve the best results.
You need to run **MonteCarloAndAi.py** in order for a program to be executed.
You can see the start parameters from the main.py, which are ship_sizes, grid_size the actual position of ships in a grid and number of Monte Carlo simulations.
The code is not perfect, but if you try to change anything, it will break, so by the old principle of "if it works, do not touch" run it and enjoy it. But of course use it in educational purposes only(no cheating in family games).
And at the end, Professor Monika jan, we hope you will grade fairly for this huge project :D
